Spotify Wrappedis a feature presenting Spotify users’ 100 most played songs from the past year.
In 2021, Spotify Wrapped calculated an “Audio Aura” for each user, a “reading of [their] two most prominent moods
as dictated by [their] top songs and artists of the year.”
Suppose Spotify determines an audio aura by looking at the average energy, valence, and danceability of
a person’s top 100 songs from the past year. In answers.txt, reflect on the following questions:

1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Answer: I would use SQL to calculate the average energy valence and danceability.
I would have a table that characterises the different numbers that I would get into the different auras available
2. Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Answer: It might not be representative as some people like listening to different genres of music.
We can take avoid taking into account anomalies
