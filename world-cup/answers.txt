Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: None. As the number of simulations increased, the time taen to run the simulations increased, as I expected

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 100000. I feel that 10, 000 and anything below is way too small of a number, while a million is way too many test cases.
